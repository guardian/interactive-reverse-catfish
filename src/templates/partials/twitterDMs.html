<p>But about two weeks later I receive a message on Twitter from a different woman:</p>

<p class='uit-body__twitter-dm is-animatable'>Hey I know you don’t know me but I think you should know that someone has been using your pictures to catfish me haha, I thought you should know and it sucks when someone does that. </p>

<p>Soon after this another woman messages me.</p>

<p class='uit-body__twitter-dm is-animatable'>Hi, sorry to bug you</p>

<p class='uit-body__twitter-dm is-animatable'>But there is someone on the internet who stole your photos, and is using them to try and catfish people. It just happened to my friend. I just figured you’d wanna know</p>
