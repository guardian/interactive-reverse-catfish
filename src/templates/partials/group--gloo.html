        <p class='is-group-step'>I decide to make a page called Gorgeous Ladies of Oklahoma, or Gloo. I only have one real shot to get access to his account, so to maximise my chances I want him to follow me first. This means I need to create the perfect account for him, and pay Instagram to promote it in his area.</p>

        <p class='is-group-step'>A couple of my female friends agree to let me post some of their vacation photos designed to get likes from men, otherwise known as “thirst traps”. One is a selfie of my friend lying by a pool, while another shows my friend in swimwear, looking out over a mountain range in Mexico. I add captions such as: “This is Chelsea. She’s 24 and loves sunbathing, lounging by the pool, Elena Ferrante and #tailgating ☀🍹❤” and hashtag them #babe (which already has 14m posts tagged with it on Instagram) #bikinibabe (853,000), #BabesofInstagram (1m) and #beachtime (2.9m).</p>

        <p class='is-group-step is-last-step'>But then an obvious problem arises: why would John follow an account with only 10 followers? So I pay $18 and get 1,000 followers from sites called CoinCrack and Buzzoid. I also buy likes powered by bots – with just $15 I get 1,000. They slowly pour into my account over the next 24 hours, their slow pace helping them avoid Instagram’s fake like detectors.</p>
